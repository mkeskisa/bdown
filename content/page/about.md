Greetings traveler!

My name is Markus Keski-Säntti and I’m 25-year-old guy from northern Finland. I’m interested in finance, data-analysis, games and simulations. I completed BSc and MSc in economics with finance as my major in Oulu Business School. I am not a native English speaker so articles can, and probably will, have a high brain fart count.
